# Distraction Blocker â€” Personalised Minimal New Tab

A minimal Chrome extension that replaces your new tab page with a clean, distraction-free dashboard featuring:

- A Google search bar
- TryHackMe badge
- GitHub contributions (current and last month, via GraphQL API)
- Customizable background image
- Extension options/settings page

## The Idea ðŸ’¡

On a random lazy day I came across the badging in TryHackMe that showed the iframe packet that changed according to the users work being done in tryhackme portal. And i started thinking, if I had such an extension that shows my cuurent streak and badge count on my homescreen it can motivate me to maintain that streak. But unfortunatly no such extention was seen in Chrome web store. So I though what is I made such an extension. I went to ChatGPT's extension GPT module and started telling my requirements. and it gave me a working extension but with a shitty UI. Next I did some research and started working on this project and made a glassy type modern and aesthically pleasing UI design with the help of Github Co-pilot.

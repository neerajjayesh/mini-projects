# 🛠️ Mini Projects  

This repository is a collection of **small projects and experiments** that I’ve built while learning and exploring different technologies.  
It’s not limited to one language or framework — I might put **anything** here that helps me practice and learn.  

Think of it as a **playground** or **dumpster** for all my mini-projects.  

Each folder contains:  
- The **source code** for the project  
- A **README.md** about what I learned
